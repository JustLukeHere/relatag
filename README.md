# relatag
A Python module to search Twitter for a hashtag and generate a list of the most common tags to appear alongside it.

**Important note for people that don't own this repo:** There's not much here yet - come back later. This project will be a simple data mining sort of experiment thing to try and find mutual frequency relationships between words.

**Update: Another note:** If you can think of a better name than 'relatag' (you probably can) then submit an issue thing.
